# EVALUATORR
Evaluation for french essays in Collège, 12-15yo^^

---

## Versioning

- **v1.0**: initial prototype (single-file evaluator, basic heuristics)
- **v2.0**: strict “two-pass” system + teacher feedback + hard gates
- **v2.1**: home screen + navigation + UX improvements
- **v2.2**: reports/export and/or history (depending on build)
- **v2.3**: `segUnits` (literary segmentation), 3rd-person POV signals, Pass 3 “Excellence” bonus

See `CHANGELOG.md` for details.

## Limitations (Important)

- Evaluatorr cannot truly “understand” a story the way a human teacher does.
- Heuristics may misjudge:
  - very experimental styles,
  - dialogues-heavy texts,
  - extremely short/long submissions,
  - unusual vocabulary or names.
- The tool is best used as:
  - a **consistent baseline**,  
  - a **feedback accelerator**,  
  - a **training aid** for revision,
  not as an unquestionable authority.

---

## Roadmap Ideas

- Calibration mode (compare tool score vs. teacher reference scores)
- Batch evaluation (multi-text import/export)
- Optional rubric customization per teacher/class
- Better dialogue handling and paragraph inference
- Safer spelling proxies and improved false-positive control
